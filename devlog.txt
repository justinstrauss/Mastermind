Team Flying Ostrich Bouquet Development Log
Mastermind Board Game by Marc Katz and Justin Strauss

Friday 1/24/14:
We sucessfully submitted our project.

Thursday 1/23/14:
We attempted to complete the GUI using the JButton setup we worked on, but we encountered obstacles integrating it with the existing Game class driver file.

Wednesday 1/22/14:
We experimented with different board setups including two dimensional arrays of JButtons, JPanels, and Colors.

Tuesday: 1/21/14:
We researched Java GUI options and compared Swing versus AWT.

Saturday 1/18/14 to Monday 1/20/14:
We completed the Game class, thereby finishing the terminal version of gameplay for Mastermind.

Friday 1/17/14:
We began work on the Game class, which controls gameplay, making sure it adhereed to the specifications of the other classes along the way.

Thursday 1/16/14:
We finished the Rows class, which keeps track of the rows of pegs, each of which represents a turn of the game.

Wednesday 1/15/14:
We completed the PlayPegs and Indicator subclasses and built a framework for the Rows class.

Tuesday 1/14/14:
We began writing the PlayPegs and Indicator subclasses, both of which extend the Pegs superclasses.

Monday 1/13/14:
We coded the Pegs superclass, which is a basis for the PlayPegs and Indicator subclasses.

Friday 1/10/14:
We made the skeleton files with the required methods and discussed our approach to gameplay.
